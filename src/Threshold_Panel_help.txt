Public functions
=================

estimate_tpm(endo, exo, rexo, thresh, opts[null])
-------------------------------------------------
Parameters:
endo         - series, endogenous series
exo          - list, regime-independend regressors
rexo         - list, regime-dependend exogenous (currently only single
               entry supported)
thresh       - series, threshold variable
opts         - bundle, Configure estimation parameters (optional)

Returns: Bundle comprising various information.


plot_tpm(model, path[null])
---------------------------
Parameters:
model        - bundle, returned bundlde from estimate_tpm() function
path         - string, Diretory where to store plots (optional). If not
               specified, plots appear immediately on screen. If specified,
               the figure(s) will be named "ThresholdPanel_CI_No=X.png"
               where X refers to the number of thresholds.

Returns: Nothing


Default model and estimation values
===================================
The following default parameters are set:

- <nthresholds = 1>: Number of thresholds, default: 1
- <with_timeeffects = TRUE>: Estimate model tith time-effects, default: TRUE
- <scalar nquantiles = 200>: Number of quantiles to analys, default: 200
- <scalar nboot = 299>: Number of boostrap replications, default: 299
   # Hansen (1999) trim_1=0.01, trim_2=0.01, trim_3=0.05
- <matrix trimming_values = vec({0.01, 0.01, 0.05})>: Percentages to trim
   the sample start and end for each of max. three thresholds.
- <scalar alpha = 0.5>: Choose a rather high value if you want to estimate
   the refinement coefficient values.
- <scalar confidence_level = 0.95>: Level of confidence for threshold
   estimates

The "opts" parameter bundle
============================
The user can pass various parameters to estimate_tmp() to over-write the default values listed above.
To do so, you simple pass a bundle where the key must match the name of
the parameter you want to replace by a specific value. See the sample script
for an illustration.
